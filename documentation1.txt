It just show's how to build an image classification model using Python, not professional technical pattern detection yet.

THESE ARE FAKE PATTERNS:
Synthetic candlestick-style line charts (not real candlestick patterns like pin bar or hammer)
Auto-generated using random price trends in the script
these patterns was taken from 300  chart images 
These are fake/simulated training images just to test how well a CNN can learn from chart shape.
CNN: Convolutional Neural Network


 What I Just Built:
✅ A real-time intraday stock predictor

✅ With RSI + MACD logic

✅ Streamlit frontend

✅ Auto charts, clean UI

✅ Bug-free final code
